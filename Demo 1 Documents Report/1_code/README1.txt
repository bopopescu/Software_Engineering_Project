Proximity README1

Proximity is a web app for finding events and friends in real life. We currently aren’t hosting it on a server so to use it you will have to install angular so you can run it locally. Follow these steps to do this.

Go to our Github page (https://github.com/Rdubya54/Software_Engineering_Project) and download the project as a zip. 

Install the latest version of Node.js on your machine.

Open the program “Node.js command prompt”.
Cd into the downloaded folder. Keep cding until you are inside the folder Proximity Angular.

Now run the command “npm install -g @angular/cli”. This installs Angular on your machine which is required to run our app locally.

Now run the command “ng serve --open”. The app will now be running at http://localhost:4200/login. You will have to open a browser and type this into a url if it doesn’t open automatically.
